## Week 1 - History of Writing
- The caves of Lascaux in France hold some of the earliest writing (30k Years ago)
- The Gutenberg press revolutionised the process of printing with metal moveable type.
- Modern type writers came along to make typing a thing that most people are able to afford.

  ## Week 2 - Representing Text and Numbers in Computers
  - Computers use 2 bits, 1 and 0, as a way of expressing information. 8bit form a byte.
  - A computer's memory is made up of a string of bytes that convey information.
  - A form of type called ASCII can be used to represent letters as numbers of bits.
 
  ## Week 3 - Structure of Text
  - Text files consist of lines, which can be used to indicate text.
  - Line breaks and other special charaters are often represented in ASCII.
  - Markup languages are used to write simple text, as is being done right now.
 
  ## Week 4 - Keyboards and Text Editors:
  - Keyboard and mouse are the main way to communicate with the computer.
  - An Integrated Development Environment is used to program code. Some know ones are Webstorm and Visual Studio.
  - CTRL+F can be used to search for keywords in text
 
  ## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces
  - CLIs used to be the only way to interact with a computer.
  - CLI's are relatively basic, meaning they can run on most machines without much issue.
  - On windows, the terminal may be opened through the windows menu.
